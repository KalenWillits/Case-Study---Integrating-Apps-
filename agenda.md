# Agenda for next mentor call
*Jun 27th, 2020*
*How many of these different statistical tests can you remember? How much do you remember about what the appropriate conditions are under which to use them?*

- I remembered normal, pearson, T, Poisson, and Rgression. However I don't feel that memorizing these distributions is as helpful as knowing where to look for them.

- You are to use them when the appropriate distribution is discovered in your data.
